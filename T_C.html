Since there is no cashback on EMI transactions, once a transaction is converted into EMI, the customer will not earn any cashback on the transaction even if the customer opts for foreclosure or cancellation of the EMI and pays the full amount on the same.
For customers who wish to foreclose their EMI transactions, customers would need to call up Kotak Mahindra Bank customer care and place a request for the same.
The cashback will be rounded down for each individual transaction. For eg., If for a transaction of Rs. 1750, the customer is eligible for a cashback of 1.25% i.e., 1750 * 1.25% = Rs. 21.875. Only Rs. 21 will be credited to the customer for that individual transaction.
The following MCCs have been excluded from cashback eligibility (for fuel, wallet load): 6012, 6051, 5541, 5983, 5542, 5944, 6011, 6540 &6513 (Rent Payments) will also be excluded from cashback eligibility.
Cashback of 5% categories (Accelerated Cashback) will be calculated basis the Merchant IDs (MIDs) shared by the respective merchants. Kotak Mahindra Bank shall not be held liable if a transaction on any of these merchants does not earn accelerated cashback.
The terms and conditions mentioned in the document can be revised or terminated at any time with 30 days prior notice.
The cashback shall not be applicable if the Card has been withdrawn or cancelled or is liable to be cancelled or the account of the Card member is a delinquent Account.
